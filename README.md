this repository is for APPM 4600 Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing
So far there are three things here in the root directory
The first is this readme the next two are two folders for labs and homeworks
The homeworks lab contains the work done for the homeworks
the labs folder contains the work done for the labs

this repository contains python code for algorithms that are supposed to do math
the earlier code is supposed to be used in the later code, the idea is that it keeps building on itself
also the algorithms are suopposed to be stable
